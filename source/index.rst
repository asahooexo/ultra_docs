Introduction
======================================
``ultra`` repository comprises analytical algorithms which is used to compute wavefront tolerances for
segmented primary mirror relevant to the scenario of exo-earth imaging with future large space telescopes.
It leverages the PASTIS algorithm, and a close-loop recursive algorithm to estimate the static and dynamic
wavefront tolerances for segmented mirrors during a science observation.
